Hello, my name is Tom and I am a recovering alcoholic and addict. If you have watched The Mowgli's YouTube videos or listened to their sound on Spotify, you might be surprised to learn that the the band has been through a tragic time: A member of the band overdosed on heroin in a car accident (he was the driver) and passed away.
The band was devastated by this tragedy and we all wanted to help them in any way we could so we decided to make a music video to raise money for the group.
The band has told us that they've helped many people through music, and we wanted to give back to them to help them continue to spread positive vibes to any listener that is struggling with addiction.
In lieu of a fee, we ask that you pledge to any amount, which will be donated to the group's Help Them Help Others Fund. We believe that it's important to help those in need, and we hope that you'll contribute

Hello, my name is Jonathan. I am an English teacher and an American citizen. I have been living in China for the20 years.
Our English teaching program is designed to bring the right balance between learning English and enjoying learning about China at the same time. An English course should be designed in a way that you have fun and learn a lot.
Most of my students have been in China for a few months or years. They are often preparing for a work interview for a job position in China. Others are planning to visit China for sightseeing.
This is a good place for new students to start their journey to learn English and make friends in China.
I am now here to teach English and help students get a better understanding of China. I am an enthusiastic English teacher and I love teaching and interacting with students.
I will provide you with a friendly environment to learn English.

If you’re not allowed to say ‘I’m at Wimbledon’ then what on earth are you supposed to call it?
Jade Edwards
It’s one of the biggest events of the sporting calendar, and yet it’s also one of the most confusing to call.
For the past fortnight Wimbledon fans have been bombarded with an army of tennis terms that seem to confuse the general public. I was caught up in it myself.
Now that the epic two-week tournament is over, we can reveal that the correct term to use for the event we mostly just hear about is actually “Wimbledon.”
And, according to our insiders, we should also start referring to the tennis championships as the “Wimbledon

Hello, my name is Tomás. I am 24 years old and I am a student of Medicine at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico.
I met the Foundation on March 9, 2018. I was already a little concerned about my hair, as I had started to notice a little alopecia. At the time, I was in the 3rd year of medical school, and every time I went to class the professors commented that I was losing my hair. I had a bad feeling, but you have to deal with everything that life brings.
September 2018 I decided to start a new hair transplant program, but that month I lost more hair. By that time, I had already spent a lot of money on those programs.
I went to the hair clinic to ask questions, I learned a lot, and then I decided to do the rejuvenation program. At that time I had already bought the hair transplant program that I

The "Un-Ripped" Naked Truth
The Nude 2000
One thing that has really changed for me, and for many of us, is how my body has changed. In my late teens to mid-twenties I was a little extra endowed. My body is fairly symmetrical with a little bigger than average breasts, hips, buttocks, shoulders, and chest. Then my breasts grew to the point where I had to buy a full size bra. The weight of the breasts alone was enough that I couldn't find a bra that fit me that I liked. My hips and buttocks became bigger than they were, and my shoulders and chest widened. I was a full 3XL, 272 pounds. I did not have a single dress that fit me
